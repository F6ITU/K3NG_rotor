# K3NG_rotor
Yet another K3NG rotator controler pcb

This implementation is based on an Arduino Mega board and a pair of 4x relay boards to drive an AZ-EL antenna system.

Most basic functions are directly driven via Molex KK 254 connectors (up/down, right/left, lcd display output, GPS input, *
I2C extensions... etc). All other "vacant" gpio could be used via solderpads. 

Board could be powered from 8 to 15V
